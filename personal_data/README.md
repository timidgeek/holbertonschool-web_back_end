# Personal Data :sparkles:

This project at Holberton focuses on personal data, and PII. We will be further exploring logging in Python. The idea is that logger messaging and errors can help protect personal data.

## Learning Objectives:

- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
- How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
- How to authenticate to a database using environment variables
